# Birthweight_Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between birthweight and maternal/neonatal 
factors, and to construct  models using linear regression and other statistical techniques.

## Resserch questions

1. What are the distributions and summary statistics of birthweight and other maternal/neonatal factors?

2. Which factors are significantly associated with birthweight?

3. How accurately can we predict birthweight using regression models?

4. Are model assumptions satisfied based on diagnostics?

5. How unusual are human brain-bodyweight relationships compared to other species?
